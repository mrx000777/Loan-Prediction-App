## 🔍 Overview

The Loan Prediction System takes user input like Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income, Credit History, and more, and predicts whether the loan will be approved or not.

It solves a real-world problem in the finance industry and demonstrates the **end-to-end application of data science** — from preprocessing and training to model deployment.
